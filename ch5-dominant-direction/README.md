Dominant writing direction

Write a function that computes the dominant writing direction in a string of text. Remember that each script object has a direction property that can be "ltr" (left to right), "rtl" (right to left), or "ttb" (top to bottom).

The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the characters that have a script associated with them. The characterScript and countBy functions defined earlier in the chapter are probably useful here.


Hints:
Your solution might look a lot like the first half of the textScripts example. You again have to count characters by a criterion based on characterScript and then filter out the part of the result that refers to uninteresting (script-less) characters.

Finding the direction with the highest character count can be done with reduce. If itâ€™s not clear how, refer to the example earlier in the chapter, where reduce was used to find the script with the most characters.

function textScripts(text) {
  let scripts = countBy(text, char => {
    let script = characterScript(char.codePointAt(0));
    return script ? script.name : "none";
  }).filter(({name}) => name != "none");

  let total = scripts.reduce((n, {count}) => n + count, 0);
  if (total == 0) return "No scripts found";

  return scripts.map(({name, count}) => {
    return `${Math.round(count * 100 / total)}% ${name}`;
  }).join(", ");
}
